# 🖥️ Panacloud Website (HTML & CSS Only)

This is a **static website** built using pure **HTML5 and CSS3**, created to simulate a professional, branded layout inspired by Panacloud’s design principles. While not yet responsive, the structure is clean and ideal for understanding semantic HTML and custom styling techniques.
